#PokemonApp
SPA done as an individual project for a coding bootcamp.
In this app you will see a list of Pokemons obtained from a REST API to which you can apply filters, perform searches and order. You can also access to each Pokemon details where you will find its stats, evolution chain, types, height and weight. In addition, you have the option to create a new Pok√©mon, assigning it the values that you desire. Afterwards you can delete or update these created Pokemons.
